# BaseI6_updater
The firmware FlyPlus comes from Dave Borthwick ( http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/member.php?u=626757 ). Thanks to him!

Easy update:
Edit the run.bat file: replace the '3' after the '-n' option with your COM port number.
Put your transmitter in update mode.
Double click on 'run.bat'.
