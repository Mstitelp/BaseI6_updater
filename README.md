# BaseI6_updater

The firmware FlyPlus comes from Dave Borthwick ( http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/member.php?u=626757 ). Thanks to him!

Easy upload:
* Edit the run.bat file: replace the '3' after the '-n' option with your COM port number
* Edit the run.bat by placing the path to the firmware you want to upload after the '-p' option
* Put your transmitter in update mode
* Double click on 'run.bat'
* Wait until upload is completed
* Profit
